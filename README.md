# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Goal:** Predict whether a customer will leave a company using demographic and service-related data — and help businesses reduce churn through proactive retention strategies.

---

## 📌 Overview

Customer churn refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. For subscription-based services like telecom, churn directly impacts revenue. This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on features such as demographics, account history, and service usage.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

We aim to build a classification model that:

* Identifies customers who are likely to churn.
* Helps the business retain customers by taking early actions.

By analyzing features like **tenure, internet service type, monthly charges**, and more, we can generate actionable insights for reducing churn.

## 📊 Dataset Information

* **Dataset name:** `customer_data.csv`
* **Records:** 7,043 rows, 21 columns
* **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Exploration**

* Checked for null values, data types, and distributions.
* Found 11 missing values in `TotalCharges`.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

* Handled missing values and converted `TotalCharges` to numeric.
* Applied **Label Encoding** to binary categorical features.
* Used **One-Hot Encoding** for multi-class categorical features.
* Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**.

### 3. **Modeling**

* Split data using an 80/20 **Train/Test** split.
* Trained and tested multiple models:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest Classifier
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 4. **Evaluation**

* Evaluated using:

  * **Accuracy**
  * **Precision**
  * **Recall**
  * **F1 Score**
  * **ROC-AUC**
* Plotted confusion matrices and heatmaps for clarity.



## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Python**
* **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
* **scikit-learn**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
